# Factors-Affecting-Teen-Pregnancy-Rate
# Finding the Main Factors Affecting Teen Pregnancy
This project looks at various socio-economic and political data to find factors that strongly correlate with increases in teen pregnancy rate. I aggregated, cleaned, and analyzed data related to religion, education, politics, state GDP, population density, and public school funding.

### Key Questions Explored:
- Which of the studied variables significantly correlate with teen pregnancy rate?
- Which factor most strongly affects teen pregnancy rate?

### Techniques used:
- pandas for data cleaning
- matplotlib for data visualization
- scikitlearn for linear regression

### Key Findings:
- Religiosity in each state appears to have the strongest effect on teen pregnancy rate, followed by education level of residents and population density.
